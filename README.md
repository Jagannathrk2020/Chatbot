The challenge for this video is to make your own Q&A System using any type of memory network (plain, end-to-end, or dynamic). You can even use the code in this repository verbatim, just modify it so that a user can ask it questions from the command line. This will be a good way to get familiar with this type of bleeding edge deep learning model.
